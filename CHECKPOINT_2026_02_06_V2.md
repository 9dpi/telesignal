# Progress Checkpoint: TeleSignal UI & AI Branding Polish
**Date:** February 06, 2026
**Status:** Completed v2 Refinement

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Live Executions Table Enhancements
- **Pagination:** Implemented pagination (10 rows/page) to handle growing signal history. Increased fetch limit to 50 for better historical coverage.
- **Column Optimization:**
    - **ID:** Widened to show full signal IDs.
    - **Win/Loss:** Added dedicated column showing profit/loss in pips (e.g., `+10.5 pips`, `-5.2 pips`) with color coding.
    - **Result Removal:** Merged result badges into the Status/Result column to reduce clutter.
    - **Renaming:** Changed "Conf" to **"AI Score"** and "Confidence" to **"AI Probability"** for a more technical feel.
- **Layout:** Switched to `table-layout: fixed` with `%` widths and `min-width: 1000px` to ensure the table fills the screen without crushing content.

### 2. Live Trade Monitoring (Web UI)
- **PnL Visualizer:** Added a dynamic progress bar for active signals that tracks current price relative to SL, Entry, and TP in real-time.
- **Historical View:** When no active signal is present, the UI automatically displays the last completed signal for context.

### 3. AI Branding & Professionalism
- **Branding Header:** Replaced "NEW SIGNAL" with **"QUANTIX AI PREDICTION"**.
- **Contextual Labels:** Added "Pre-Market Structure Analysis" and "Generated by Quantix Core v2.1" to emphasize the predictive nature of the system.
- **Footer:** Added a professional application footer with copyright information and dummy links for Terms/Privacy.

### 4. Layout & Performance
- **Logs Panel Removal:** Deleted the execution logs panel to provide maximum vertical space for the signal table.
- **CSS Syntax Fixes:** Resolved structural breakage caused by nested CSS and missing brackets.

### 5. Backend & Notification Consistency
- **Telegram Templates:** Updated `telegram_notifier_v2.py` to reflect new lifecycle rules (15m entry window, 35m max trade duration).
- **Data Integration:** Fixed Confidence display on Web UI by prioritizing `ai_confidence` fields and handling float-to-percentage conversions correctly.

## Repository Status
- **GitHub:** All changes committed and pushed to `main` branch.
- **Branch:** `main` (Latest commit includes UI branding and pagination fixes).

## Next Steps
1. **User Action:** Manually verify the live progress bar during the next active trade.
2. **Performance:** Monitor Supabase usage as history grows; consider server-side pagination if history exceeds 500+ records.
3. **Advanced Features:** Potential for adding "Risk Management" calculator or "AI Sentiment" indicators in the sidebar.
